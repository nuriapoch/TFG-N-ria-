Assessing properly the speech of people with aphasia favours the recovery of their communicative abilities. As a result of current technological evolution, it is possible the automation of basic tasks in the process. In this context, a project ruled by the Polytechnic University of Catalonia aims to create a system that automatically detects the severity degree of aphasia in Catalan language. The work presented here is framed within that project with a double objective: to participate in the data preprocessing phase, involving the transcription of speeches with various types of aphasia, and to develop and execute an algorithm that enables the automation of their analysis using spaCy, a Python library. During the course of this work, it has been observed that current natural language processing tools for Catalan have certain limitations in performing complete analyses, due to the limited number of available resources and the lack of written data in that language.
